 <p align=”justify”>The company has achieved significant growth in its operations in recent years and has established a track record of successfully integrating and leveraging its manufacturing facilities and other resources. Its operations have grown significantly from a company with a limited product portfolio to the current wide range of over 400 licensed branded /generic allopathic formulations manufactured in-house and a large range of OTC, Ayurvedic, Body Care, Healthcare and Medical Devices produced by competent channel partners.</p>
 
 <p align="justyfy">The company has inherent strength and competitive edge to grow faster in comparison to others. The strength of the company lies in its strong product portfolio, strong R&D team, strong marketing and distribution infrastructure, strong regulatory team and of course, a very focused management with clarity in vision as enumerated below:</p>
<h4>Strong Regulatory Team</h4>
 <p align="justyfy">The company is operating in the overseas markets, hence it is mandatory to get the products registered with the regulatory authorities of different countries having stringent criterion for product registration. Nestor gives unprecedented importance to the regulatory compliances. The company has evolved a separate division for regulatory compliances and product registration consisting of eminent and distinguished professionals having wide experience and exposure to the regulatory norms of different countries. It is a result of hard and dedicated work of the regulatory department that today, the company has a large number of products already registered or under advanced stages of registration.</p>

 <h4>Development of New Products</h4>

<p align="justyfy">R & D capability is being developed in Goa. In terms of new formulations, the company is focusing on developing products such as antibiotics, pain management, muscle relaxant, cough and cold reliever, stress reliever, acidity reliever and nerve disorder. Special emphasis is on the development of semi solids for the domestic and export OTC market. The new product development is expensive and time consuming. The company is continuously investing in development of new formulations which are expected to be launched shortly in the indian domestic markets as well as in the international markets.</p>
