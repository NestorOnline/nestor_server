            <h4>Refund</h4>
            <p>At www.nestoronline.in, we do our best to ensure that you are completely satisfied with our products. We will be happy to issue a full refund based on the conditions listed in this policy below.</p>

            <h4>Full refund possible if:</h4>
            <p align="justify">you received a defective item;</p>
            <p align="justify">the ordered item(s) is lost or damaged during transit;</p>
            <p align="justify">the ordered item(s) is past its expiry date.</p>

            <p align="justify">Please Note: Mode of refund may vary depending on circumstances. If the mode of refund is by Credit/Debit Card or Net Banking, please allow 4 to 7 working days for the credit to appear in your account. While we regret any inconvenience caused by this time frame, it is the bank's policy that delays the refund timing and we have no control over that. If the mode of refund is by wallet, credit should be available within 72 hours.</p>

However, should you receive an incomplete order, damaged or incorrect product(s), please notify our customer support immediately or within 2 working days of receiving the products, to ensure prompt resolution. Please note that we will not accept liability for such delivery issues if you fail to notify us after 2 working days of receipt.
We also understand that various circumstances may arise leading you to want to return a product or products that are not defective. In these cases, we may allow the return of unopened, unused products after deducting a 50% charge, only if you notify us within 3 working days of receipt.
